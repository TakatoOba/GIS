# hello world 

 My name is Takato Oba.

I am a fourth-year student at the Faculty of Economics at Reitaku University and I ski and road bike.
I spent two years of high school in New Zealand, where I trained daily with Olympic athletes.
Since becoming a university student, I have been working on technical skiing and this year I went to All-Japan!


Best regards.
